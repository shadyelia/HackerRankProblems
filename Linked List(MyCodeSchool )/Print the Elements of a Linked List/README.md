# Print the Elements of a Linked List :
- Print the Elements of
a Linked List
This challenge is part of a MyCodeSchool tutorial track and is accompanied by a video lesson.
If you're new to linked lists, this is a great exercise for learning about them. Given a pointer to the head
node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating
the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.
Input Format
The first line of input contains , the number of elements in the linked list. The next lines contain one
element each, which are the elements of the linked list.
Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.
Constraints
, where is the element of the linked list.
Output Format
Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using printf, cout, etc.).
There should be one element per line.
